## I hate this routine:
- open terminal
- cd to project location
- activate virtual env ( if included)
- enter command to open in IDE
- Run server/vms

I hate it because I have to do it with every project. Every day.

SO because I hate it so much, I' making a tool to help me <strong>**write most of all that only once per project**</strong>,
then reduce the entire routine to two steps only afterwards;
- open terminal
- tell opn (this tool) what project to open in an IDE and what commands to run after.

> The "write most of all that only once per project" part:  
    - The short of it is you gotta do two things:  
    1. Put a configuration file that opn will read to get the right commands to use for the project.  
    2. add the project's location to opn's registry of projects.
    3. It was just two things. you're done.
